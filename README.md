# Lab03
This package contains an implementation of Lab03, that makes available functions for the Euclidean and Dijkstra's algorithms. The Euclidean algorithm computes the greatest common divisor of two integers, and Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. In this implementation, it calculates the shortest path from an initial node to every other node in the graph. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of this package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kerni714/Lab03")
```
